# Racing All Along 🏎️
This repository is reflection of my passion for Motorsports `WEC`, `F1` and `MotoGP`. In this repository I have worked with open-source data available for each of the sports to debreif raceweekends, analyse the data to provide insight into the performance of the teams and drivers.

### Structure of the Repo 🏗️
- `F1`: Contain an in-depth race debrief for the Saudi Arabian GP 🇸🇦, 2025
- `WEC`: Currently contains a introductory notebook for 8 Hours of Bahrain, 2025

### Upcoming 🕣
- Positively a race-debrief every week in F1 leading onto the first round of F1 calender in 2026 in Melbourne. The debrief will include the following races:
    - Sakhir, Bahrain 🇧🇭
    - Interlagos, Brazil 🇧🇷
    - Silverstone, United Kingdom 🇬🇧
    - Austin, United States of America 🇺🇸
    - Catalunya, Spain 🇪🇸
- Based on the workload I will try to provide a baseline debrief in WEC for the 8 hours of Bahrain followed by a systematic review of all the other races on the WEC calender.
